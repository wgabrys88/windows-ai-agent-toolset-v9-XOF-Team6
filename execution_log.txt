Execute exactly ONE tool per turn - never call multiple tools in one turn\n2. Always validate the previous action first by looking at the screenshot\n3. If a previous action failed two times in a row, report the goal as BLOCKED\n4. When the current goal is complete, use report_goal_status with completion_status as DONE\n5. Trust what you see in the screenshot - it shows the true state\n6.

Click on the Start menu to open it.\n2. Locate and click on the Paint application from the list of programs available in the start menu.\n3. In the Paint app, draw a simple cat using basic shapes such as oval for the body, eyes with circles or dots, nose, ears (two triangles), whiskers (lines extending from each side), tail (a curved line), and any other features to make it look like a cat.\n4. Once you have created your drawing of a cat in Paint, verify that it resembles a cat as per human perception.\n5. If the image looks like a cat, save it with the filename 'cat.jpg' on the Desktop by using the Save As feature and ensure the file is saved correctly.\n\nPREVIOUS_ACTION_INFORMATION:\nTool_used: click_screen_element\nAction_taken: clicked element 'Start Menu icon' at grid coordinates [17,980]\nReasoning_was: To initiate the process of opening Paint, I need to click on what appears to be the Start Menu button located at the bottom-left corner of the screen.

This is a standard way for Windows operating systems to open up the start menu which will contain access to various applications including Paint.\nExpected_result: Clicked: Start Menu icon\n\nYOUR_RESPONSIBILITIES:\nYou execute computer actions by looking at screenshots and using tools.\nYou call exactly ONE tool per turn.\nYou validate if the previous action worked before choosing the next action.\n\nEXECUTION_PROTOCOL:\n\nSTEP_ONE: VALIDATE_PREVIOUS_ACTION\nLook at the current screenshot carefully.\nIf there was a previous action from the last turn, check if it succeeded.\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- Did the expected window, menu, dialog, or text appear on screen?\n- Did the UI change in the way the previous action was supposed to cause?\n- Is the screen now showing what the previous action was trying to achieve?\n\nIf the previous action worked, note success and what you see as proof.\nIf the previous action failed, note failure and what you see as proof.\n\nSTEP_TWO: CHOOSE_ONE_ACTION\nBased on what you see in the current screenshot and your instructions from the Planner, select exactly ONE tool to call.\nExplain your reasoning in the reasoning field of that tool.\n\nYOUR_RESPONSE_MUST_FOLLOW_THIS_STRUCTURE:\n\nLAST_ACTION_RESULT: [If this is first turn write \"No previous action\" otherwise write \"Success - describe the UI change you see that proves it worked\" OR \"Failed - describe what you see that proves it did not work\"]\n\nCURRENT_GOAL: [The specific goal you are working on right now from your instructions]\n\nSUCCESS_CRITERIA: [How you will know when this current goal is complete]\n\nSCREEN_SHOWS: [Describe in detail what you see in the current screenshot]\n\nNEXT_STEP: [Name the tool you are about to call and explain briefly why]\n\nSCREEN_COORDINATE_SYSTEM:\nThe screen uses a grid from 0 to 1000 in both X and Y directions.\nTop-left corner is position [0, 0].\nTop-right corner is position [1000, 0].\nBottom-left corner is position [0, 1000].\nBottom-right corner is position [1000, 1000].\nCenter of screen is position [500, 500].\n\nWhen you see an element on the LEFT side of the screen, use x between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element on the RIGHT side of the screen, use x between 700 and 1000.\nWhen you see an element at the TOP of the screen, use y between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element at the BOTTOM of the screen, use y between 700 and 1000.\n\nCRITICAL_RULES:\n1. Execute exactly ONE tool per turn - never call multiple tools in one turn\n2. Always validate the previous action first by looking at the screenshot\n3. If a previous action failed two times in a row, report the goal as BLOCKED\n4. When the current goal is complete, use report_goal_status with completion_status as DONE\n5. Trust what you see in the screenshot - it shows the true state\n6. Be precise with coordinate positions based on what you see\n\nAVAILABLE_TOOLS:\nYou have these tools for execution:\n- click_screen_element, double_click_screen_element, right_click_screen_element\n- drag_screen_element\n- type_text_input\n- press_keyboard_key\n- scroll_screen_down, scroll_screen_up\n- report_goal_status\n- report_mission_complete\n\nYou do NOT have access to planning tools like update_execution_plan or archive_completed_actions.\n"

[15:05:59] Plan updated: The previous attempts were not successful because they did not properly interact with the Start Menu or Paint application, which may have been due to incorrect targeting of elements in the interface (e.g., Task Manager). This plan addresses these issues by clearly specifying steps for opening Paint and creating a cat drawing. It also includes verification criteria that ensure success.

Click on the Start Menu icon to open it.\n2. Look for and click on 'Paint' in the list of applications inside the Start menu, or search for Paint if not immediately visible.\n3. Once Paint is opened, use the drawing tools (e.g., pencil, brush) to sketch a simple cat shape using basic lines and curves that resemble feline features such as ears, eyes, nose, whiskers, body, tail, etc.\n4. After creating the drawing, verify from a human perspective if it resembles a cat by checking for these key elements: distinct head with two pointed ears, round or almond-shaped eye area, small rounded nose and mouth, whisker lines extending outward from each ear, curved backline forming an outline of body, tail that curves upwards or ends in a loop.\n5. Once satisfied the drawing resembles a cat, save it as 'cat.jpg' on the Desktop with no file extension added (e.g., saving to desktop will create filename: cat.jpg).\n6. Confirm completion by verifying the saved image is named correctly and located at the Desktop.\n\nPREVIOUS_ACTION_INFORMATION:\nTool_used: click_screen_element\nAction_taken: clicked element 'Start menu icon' at grid coordinates [17,980]\nReasoning_was: The Start menu icon is located at the bottom-left corner of screen. Clicking this element will open up the start menu which contains access to various applications including Paint.\nExpected_result: Clicked: Start menu icon\n\nYOUR_RESPONSIBILITIES:\nYou execute computer actions by looking at screenshots and using tools.\nYou call exactly ONE tool per turn.\nYou validate if the previous action worked before choosing the next action.\n\nEXECUTION_PROTOCOL:\n\nSTEP_ONE: VALIDATE_PREVIOUS_ACTION\nLook at the current screenshot carefully.\nIf there was a previous action from the last turn, check if it succeeded.\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- Did the expected window, menu, dialog, or text appear on screen?\n- Did the UI change in the way the previous action was supposed to cause?\n- Is the screen now showing what the previous action was trying to achieve?\n\nIf the previous action worked, note success and what you see as proof.\nIf the previous action failed, note failure and what you see as proof.\n\nSTEP_TWO: CHOOSE_ONE_ACTION\nBased on what you see in the current screenshot and your instructions from the Planner, select exactly ONE tool to call.\nExplain your reasoning in the reasoning field of that tool.\n\nYOUR_RESPONSE_MUST_FOLLOW_THIS_STRUCTURE:\n\nLAST_ACTION_RESULT: [If this is first turn write \"No previous action\" otherwise write \"Success - describe the UI change you see that proves it worked\" OR \"Failed - describe what you see that proves it did not work\"]\n\nCURRENT_GOAL: [The specific goal you are working on right now from your instructions]\n\nSUCCESS_CRITERIA: [How you will know when this current goal is complete]\n\nSCREEN_SHOWS: [Describe in detail what you see in the current screenshot]\n\nNEXT_STEP: [Name the tool you are about to call and explain briefly why]\n\nSCREEN_COORDINATE_SYSTEM:\nThe screen uses a grid from 0 to 1000 in both X and Y directions.\nTop-left corner is position [0, 0].\nTop-right corner is position [1000, 0].\nBottom-left corner is position [0, 1000].\nBottom-right corner is position [1000, 1000].\nCenter of screen is position [500, 500].\n\nWhen you see an element on the LEFT side of the screen, use x between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element on the RIGHT side of the screen, use x between 700 and 1000.\nWhen you see an element at the TOP of the screen, use y between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element at the BOTTOM of the screen, use y between 700 and 1000.\n\nCRITICAL_RULES:\n1. Execute exactly ONE tool per turn - never call multiple tools in one turn\n2. Always validate the previous action first by looking at the screenshot\n3. If a previous action failed two times in a row, report the goal as BLOCKED\n4. When the current goal is complete, use report_goal_status with completion_status as DONE\n5. Trust what you see in the screenshot - it shows the true state\n6. Be precise with coordinate positions based on what you see\n\nAVAILABLE_TOOLS:\nYou have these tools for execution:\n- click_screen_element, double_click_screen_element, right_click_screen_element\n- drag_screen_element\n- type_text_input\n- press_keyboard_key\n- scroll_screen_down, scroll_screen_up\n- report_goal_status\n- report_mission_complete\n\nYou do NOT have access to planning tools like update_execution_plan or archive_completed_actions.\n"

Clicking this element will open up the start menu which contains access to various applications including Paint.\nExpected_result: Clicked: Start menu icon\n\nYOUR_RESPONSIBILITIES:\nYou execute computer actions by looking at screenshots and using tools.\nYou call exactly ONE tool per turn.\nYou validate if the previous action worked before choosing the next action.\n\nEXECUTION_PROTOCOL:\n\nSTEP_ONE: VALIDATE_PREVIOUS_ACTION\nLook at the current screenshot carefully.\nIf there was a previous action from the last turn, check if it succeeded.\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- Did the expected window, menu, dialog, or text appear on screen?\n- Did the UI change in the way the previous action was supposed to cause?\n- Is the screen now showing what the previous action was trying to achieve?\n\nIf the previous action worked, note success and what you see as proof.\nIf the previous action failed, note failure and what you see as proof.\n\nSTEP_TWO: CHOOSE_ONE_ACTION\nBased on what you see in the current screenshot and your instructions from the Planner, select exactly ONE tool to call.\nExplain your reasoning in the reasoning field of that tool.\n\nYOUR_RESPONSE_MUST_FOLLOW_THIS_STRUCTURE:\n\nLAST_ACTION_RESULT: [If this is first turn write \"No previous action\" otherwise write \"Success - describe the UI change you see that proves it worked\" OR \"Failed - describe what you see that proves it did not work\"]\n\nCURRENT_GOAL: [The specific goal you are working on right now from your instructions]\n\nSUCCESS_CRITERIA: [How you will know when this current goal is complete]\n\nSCREEN_SHOWS: [Describe in detail what you see in the current screenshot]\n\nNEXT_STEP: [Name the tool you are about to call and explain briefly why]\n\nSCREEN_COORDINATE_SYSTEM:\nThe screen uses a grid from 0 to 1000 in both X and Y directions.\nTop-left corner is position [0, 0].\nTop-right corner is position [1000, 0].\nBottom-left corner is position [0, 1000].\nBottom-right corner is position [1000, 1000].\nCenter of screen is position [500, 500].\n\nWhen you see an element on the LEFT side of the screen, use x between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element on the RIGHT side of the screen, use x between 700 and 1000.\nWhen you see an element at the TOP of the screen, use y between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element at the BOTTOM of the screen, use y between 700 and 1000.\n\nCRITICAL_RULES:\n1. Execute exactly ONE tool per turn - never call multiple tools in one turn\n2. Always validate the previous action first by looking at the screenshot\n3. If a previous action failed two times in a row, report the goal as BLOCKED\n4. When the current goal is complete, use report_goal_status with completion_status as DONE\n5. Trust what you see in the screenshot - it shows the true state\n6. Be precise with coordinate positions based on what you see\n\nAVAILABLE_TOOLS:\nYou have these tools for execution:\n- click_screen_element, double_click_screen_element, right_click_screen_element\n- drag_screen_element\n- type_text_input\n- press_keyboard_key\n- scroll_screen_down, scroll_screen_up\n- report_goal_status\n- report_mission_complete\n\nYou do NOT have access to planning tools like update_execution_plan or archive_completed_actions.\n"

Click on the Start Menu icon to open it.\n2. Look for and click on 'Paint' in the list of applications inside the Start menu, or search for Paint if not immediately visible.\n3. Once Paint is opened, use the drawing tools (e.g., pencil, brush) to sketch a simple cat shape using basic lines and curves that resemble feline features such as ears, eyes, nose, whiskers, body, tail, etc.\n4. After creating the drawing, verify from a human perspective if it resembles a cat by checking for these key elements: distinct head with two pointed ears, round or almond-shaped eye area, small rounded nose and mouth, whisker lines extending outward from each ear, curved backline forming an outline of body, tail that curves upwards or ends in a loop.\n5. Once satisfied the drawing resembles a cat, save it as 'cat.jpg' on the Desktop with no file extension added (e.g., saving to desktop will create filename: cat.jpg).\n6.

Click on the Start Menu icon to open it.\n2. Look for and click on 'Paint' in the list of applications inside the Start menu, or search for Paint if not immediately visible.\n3. Once Paint is opened, use the drawing tools (e.g., pencil, brush) to sketch a simple cat shape using basic lines and curves that resemble feline features such as ears, eyes, nose, whiskers, body, tail, etc.\n4. After creating the drawing, verify from a human perspective if it resembles a cat by checking for these key elements: distinct head with two pointed ears, round or almond-shaped eye area, small rounded nose and mouth, whisker lines extending outward from each ear, curved backline forming an outline of body, tail that curves upwards or ends in a loop.\n5. Once satisfied the drawing resembles a cat, save it as 'cat.jpg' on the Desktop with no file extension added (e.g., saving to desktop will create filename: cat.jpg).\n6. Confirm completion by verifying the saved image is named correctly and located at the Desktop.\n\nPREVIOUS_ACTION_INFORMATION:\nTool_used: click_screen_element\nAction_taken: clicked element 'Paint app icon in Start menu' at grid coordinates [182,305]\nReasoning_was: The Start Menu is visible and contains the Paint application icon, which I can use to open it.

Execute exactly ONE tool per turn - never call multiple tools in one turn\n2. Always validate the previous action first by looking at the screenshot\n3. If a previous action failed two times in a row, report the goal as BLOCKED\n4. When the current goal is complete, use report_goal_status with completion_status as DONE\n5. Trust what you see in the screenshot - it shows the true state\n6.

This time, I will follow a clear plan by first ensuring that we correctly access the Start menu, locate and launch Paint properly, then proceed with sketching a cat as per instructions.

Once opened, sketch a simple cat using basic shapes such as circles for ears, oval shape for body, lines for tail or legs, etc., ensuring it resembles a cat from human perspective. After completing the drawing, save the file as 'cat.jpg' on the Desktop.\n\nPREVIOUS_ACTION_INFORMATION:\nTool_used: click_screen_element\nAction_taken: clicked element 'Paint app interface' at grid coordinates [182,305]\nReasoning_was: The goal is to create a simple cat drawing using the Paint application. Since we have successfully opened it, I need to proceed with sketching by selecting appropriate tools from the toolbar and creating basic feline features like ears, eyes, nose etc., which will then be verified if they resemble those of a real cat.\nExpected_result: Clicked: Paint app interface\n\nYOUR_RESPONSIBILITIES:\nYou execute computer actions by looking at screenshots and using tools.\nYou call exactly ONE tool per turn.\nYou validate if the previous action worked before choosing the next action.\n\nEXECUTION_PROTOCOL:\n\nSTEP_ONE: VALIDATE_PREVIOUS_ACTION\nLook at the current screenshot carefully.\nIf there was a previous action from the last turn, check if it succeeded.\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- Did the expected window, menu, dialog, or text appear on screen?\n- Did the UI change in the way the previous action was supposed to cause?\n- Is the screen now showing what the previous action was trying to achieve?\n\nIf the previous action worked, note success and what you see as proof.\nIf the previous action failed, note failure and what you see as proof.\n\nSTEP_TWO: CHOOSE_ONE_ACTION\nBased on what you see in the current screenshot and your instructions from the Planner, select exactly ONE tool to call.\nExplain your reasoning in the reasoning field of that tool.\n\nYOUR_RESPONSE_MUST_FOLLOW_THIS_STRUCTURE:\n\nLAST_ACTION_RESULT: [If this is first turn write \"No previous action\" otherwise write \"Success - describe the UI change you see that proves it worked\" OR \"Failed - describe what you see that proves it did not work\"]\n\nCURRENT_GOAL: [The specific goal you are working on right now from your instructions]\n\nSUCCESS_CRITERIA: [How you will know when this current goal is complete]\n\nSCREEN_SHOWS: [Describe in detail what you see in the current screenshot]\n\nNEXT_STEP: [Name the tool you are about to call and explain briefly why]\n\nSCREEN_COORDINATE_SYSTEM:\nThe screen uses a grid from 0 to 1000 in both X and Y directions.\nTop-left corner is position [0, 0].\nTop-right corner is position [1000, 0].\nBottom-left corner is position [0, 1000].\nBottom-right corner is position [1000, 1000].\nCenter of screen is position [500, 500].\n\nWhen you see an element on the LEFT side of the screen, use x between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element on the RIGHT side of the screen, use x between 700 and 1000.\nWhen you see an element at the TOP of the screen, use y between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element at the BOTTOM of the screen, use y between 700 and 1000.\n\nCRITICAL_RULES:\n1. Execute exactly ONE tool per turn - never call multiple tools in one turn\n2. Always validate the previous action first by looking at the screenshot\n3. If a previous action failed two times in a row, report the goal as BLOCKED\n4. When the current goal is complete, use report_goal_status with completion_status as DONE\n5. Trust what you see in the screenshot - it shows the true state\n6. Be precise with coordinate positions based on what you see\n\nAVAILABLE_TOOLS:\nYou have these tools for execution:\n- click_screen_element, double_click_screen_element, right_click_screen_element\n- drag_screen_element\n- type_text_input\n- press_keyboard_key\n- scroll_screen_down, scroll_screen_up\n- report_goal_status\n- report_mission_complete\n\nYou do NOT have access to planning tools like update_execution_plan or archive_completed_actions.\n"

This will allow me to draw a circular element which is essential for creating cat ears, an important part of any feline drawing.\nExpected_result: Clicked: Circle Shape Icon\n\nYOUR_RESPONSIBILITIES:\nYou execute computer actions by looking at screenshots and using tools.\nYou call exactly ONE tool per turn.\nYou validate if the previous action worked before choosing the next action.\n\nEXECUTION_PROTOCOL:\n\nSTEP_ONE: VALIDATE_PREVIOUS_ACTION\nLook at the current screenshot carefully.\nIf there was a previous action from the last turn, check if it succeeded.\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- Did the expected window, menu, dialog, or text appear on screen?\n- Did the UI change in the way the previous action was supposed to cause?\n- Is the screen now showing what the previous action was trying to achieve?\n\nIf the previous action worked, note success and what you see as proof.\nIf the previous action failed, note failure and what you see as proof.\n\nSTEP_TWO: CHOOSE_ONE_ACTION\nBased on what you see in the current screenshot and your instructions from the Planner, select exactly ONE tool to call.\nExplain your reasoning in the reasoning field of that tool.\n\nYOUR_RESPONSE_MUST_FOLLOW_THIS_STRUCTURE:\n\nLAST_ACTION_RESULT: [If this is first turn write \"No previous action\" otherwise write \"Success - describe the UI change you see that proves it worked\" OR \"Failed - describe what you see that proves it did not work\"]\n\nCURRENT_GOAL: [The specific goal you are working on right now from your instructions]\n\nSUCCESS_CRITERIA: [How you will know when this current goal is complete]\n\nSCREEN_SHOWS: [Describe in detail what you see in the current screenshot]\n\nNEXT_STEP: [Name the tool you are about to call and explain briefly why]\n\nSCREEN_COORDINATE_SYSTEM:\nThe screen uses a grid from 0 to 1000 in both X and Y directions.\nTop-left corner is position [0, 0].\nTop-right corner is position [1000, 0].\nBottom-left corner is position [0, 1000].\nBottom-right corner is position [1000, 1000].\nCenter of screen is position [500, 500].\n\nWhen you see an element on the LEFT side of the screen, use x between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element on the RIGHT side of the screen, use x between 700 and 1000.\nWhen you see an element at the TOP of the screen, use y between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element at the BOTTOM of the screen, use y between 700 and 1000.\n\nCRITICAL_RULES:\n1. Execute exactly ONE tool per turn - never call multiple tools in one turn\n2. Always validate the previous action first by looking at the screenshot\n3. If a previous action failed two times in a row, report the goal as BLOCKED\n4. When the current goal is complete, use report_goal_status with completion_status as DONE\n5. Trust what you see in the screenshot - it shows the true state\n6. Be precise with coordinate positions based on what you see\n\nAVAILABLE_TOOLS:\nYou have these tools for execution:\n- click_screen_element, double_click_screen_element, right_click_screen_element\n- drag_screen_element\n- type_text_input\n- press_keyboard_key\n- scroll_screen_down, scroll_screen_up\n- report_goal_status\n- report_mission_complete\n\nYou do NOT have access to planning tools like update_execution_plan or archive_completed_actions.\n"

Once opened, sketch a simple cat using basic shapes such as circles for ears, oval shape for body, lines for tail or legs, etc., ensuring it resembles a cat from human perspective. After completing the drawing, save the file as 'cat.jpg' on the Desktop.\n\nPREVIOUS_ACTION_INFORMATION:\nTool_used: click_screen_element\nAction_taken: clicked element 'Circle Shape Icon' at grid coordinates [325,107]\nReasoning_was: I am going to click on the 'Circle Shape Icon' in the Shapes section of Paint's toolbar. This will allow me to draw a circular element which is essential for creating cat ears, an important part of any feline drawing.\nExpected_result: Clicked: Circle Shape Icon\n\nYOUR_RESPONSIBILITIES:\nYou execute computer actions by looking at screenshots and using tools.\nYou call exactly ONE tool per turn.\nYou validate if the previous action worked before choosing the next action.\n\nEXECUTION_PROTOCOL:\n\nSTEP_ONE: VALIDATE_PREVIOUS_ACTION\nLook at the current screenshot carefully.\nIf there was a previous action from the last turn, check if it succeeded.\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- Did the expected window, menu, dialog, or text appear on screen?\n- Did the UI change in the way the previous action was supposed to cause?\n- Is the screen now showing what the previous action was trying to achieve?\n\nIf the previous action worked, note success and what you see as proof.\nIf the previous action failed, note failure and what you see as proof.\n\nSTEP_TWO: CHOOSE_ONE_ACTION\nBased on what you see in the current screenshot and your instructions from the Planner, select exactly ONE tool to call.\nExplain your reasoning in the reasoning field of that tool.\n\nYOUR_RESPONSE_MUST_FOLLOW_THIS_STRUCTURE:\n\nLAST_ACTION_RESULT: [If this is first turn write \"No previous action\" otherwise write \"Success - describe the UI change you see that proves it worked\" OR \"Failed - describe what you see that proves it did not work\"]\n\nCURRENT_GOAL: [The specific goal you are working on right now from your instructions]\n\nSUCCESS_CRITERIA: [How you will know when this current goal is complete]\n\nSCREEN_SHOWS: [Describe in detail what you see in the current screenshot]\n\nNEXT_STEP: [Name the tool you are about to call and explain briefly why]\n\nSCREEN_COORDINATE_SYSTEM:\nThe screen uses a grid from 0 to 1000 in both X and Y directions.\nTop-left corner is position [0, 0].\nTop-right corner is position [1000, 0].\nBottom-left corner is position [0, 1000].\nBottom-right corner is position [1000, 1000].\nCenter of screen is position [500, 500].\n\nWhen you see an element on the LEFT side of the screen, use x between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element on the RIGHT side of the screen, use x between 700 and 1000.\nWhen you see an element at the TOP of the screen, use y between 0 and 300.\nWhen you see an element at the BOTTOM of the screen, use y between 700 and 1000.\n\nCRITICAL_RULES:\n1.
